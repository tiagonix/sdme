**Totals: 575 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (576 tests), 18/18 suites pass**

\* Known platform issue only (no code regression); see below.

## Failures

### verify-usage.sh: opaque/verify (1 failure)

`getfattr` did not find the `trusted.overlay.opaque` xattr on the upper
layer directory. This is environment-specific (kernel/filesystem
configuration); the same test passes on x86_64 with kernel 6.19.

## Known Issues

No known issues at this time.

## Previous Results

### 0.4.6 -- fs build refactoring (2026-03-20, aarch64)

568 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (568 tests), 17/17 suites pass.
Same known platform issue (opaque xattr on aarch64).

### 0.4.5 -- nix-build pipeline removal (2026-03-19, aarch64)

577 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (578 tests), 16/16 suites pass.
264 matrix tests (including NixOS, which has since been removed from the
matrix -- see verify-nixos.sh for dedicated NixOS testing). Removed the
built-in `DistroFamily::Nix` nix-build pipeline from sdme. NixOS rootfs
are now built externally via `test/scripts/build-nixos-rootfs.sh`.

### 0.4.4 -- openSUSE caps fix (2026-03-19, aarch64)

The built-in Suse import prehook now strips `security.capability`
xattrs from `newuidmap`/`newgidmap`, fixing the idmapped mount error
that blocked `--userns` and `--hardened` on openSUSE. The original
prehook passed both files to a single `setcap -r` invocation, but
`setcap` only accepts one file per `-r` flag -- `newgidmap` was never
stripped. Splitting into two commands fixed all 3 failures and 23
port conflict skips (33/33 openSUSE matrix tests pass).

### 0.4.2 (2026-03-17, x86_64)

System: Linux 6.19.6-2-cachyos (x86_64), systemd 259, sdme 0.4.2

577 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped (578 tests), 16/16 suites pass. All
264 matrix tests passed (including openSUSE hardened OCI apps on
x86_64).
