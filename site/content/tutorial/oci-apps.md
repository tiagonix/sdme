This tutorial shows how to import an OCI application image (nginx) and
run it inside an sdme container.

## Base OS vs application images

When importing an OCI image, sdme classifies it as either a **base OS**
or an **application**:

- **Base OS** images (ubuntu, debian, fedora) are extracted as a
  standalone sdme rootfs. They contain a full Linux distribution you
  can boot into.
- **Application** images (nginx, redis, postgres) have an entrypoint,
  commands, or exposed ports. sdme places them as a systemd service
  inside a base OS rootfs.

This detection is automatic. Application images require a base rootfs
to run inside, specified with `--base-fs`.

## How it works

The container always boots from the base OS rootfs (e.g. Ubuntu).
The application image (e.g. nginx, which may be Alpine-based
internally) is placed under `/oci/apps/{name}/root` and runs as a
chrooted systemd service inside that container. The application is
isolated with its own PID and IPC namespaces, just as it would expect
in a traditional container runtime. For more details, see the
[OCI integration](@/docs/architecture.md#16-oci-integration)
architecture and
[OCI app isolation](@/docs/security.md#13-oci-app-isolation-architecture)
security documentation.

The application runs as a regular systemd service. You get logs via
`journalctl`, restarts via `systemctl`, and cgroup resource limits,
all for free.

## Import nginx

First, make sure you have a base rootfs imported. If not:

```sh
sudo sdme fs import ubuntu docker.io/ubuntu
```

Then import nginx on top of it:

```sh
sudo sdme fs import nginx docker.io/nginx --base-fs ubuntu
```

To avoid repeating `--base-fs` on every import, set a default:

```sh
sudo sdme config set default_base_fs ubuntu
```

## Create and start the container

```sh
sudo sdme new mycontainer -r nginx
```

By default, sdme containers share the host network. This means nginx
is immediately accessible from the host:

```sh
curl http://localhost
```

You should see the nginx welcome page.

If port 80 is already in use on the host, nginx will fail to start
inside the container. Since this is an OCI app, you can modify its
config through the chrooted rootfs. Enter the OCI app shell and
change the listen port:

Use `sdme cp` to copy the config out, edit it on the host, and copy
it back:

```sh
sudo sdme cp mycontainer:/oci/apps/nginx/root/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf .
```

Edit `default.conf` to change `listen 80` to `listen 8080`, then
copy it back:

```sh
sudo sdme cp default.conf mycontainer:/oci/apps/nginx/root/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Then restart the container:

```sh
sudo sdme stop mycontainer
sudo sdme start mycontainer
```

## View logs

From the host, you can check the OCI application logs:

```sh
sudo sdme logs mycontainer --oci
```

This is equivalent to running `journalctl -u sdme-oci-nginx` inside
the container. Replace `mycontainer` with your container's name.

## Enter the OCI application

To get a shell inside the nginx chroot (not the container's base OS):

```sh
sudo sdme join mycontainer --oci
```

This drops you into the nginx rootfs at `/oci/apps/nginx/root`.
