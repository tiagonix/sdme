Pods let multiple containers share a network namespace, so they can
communicate over `127.0.0.1` without any port forwarding or bridge
configuration. This is the same model used by Kubernetes pods.

See also the [architecture documentation](@/docs/architecture.md#10-pods)
for implementation details.

## Creating a pod

```sh
sudo sdme pod new mypod
```

This creates an isolated network namespace with only a loopback
interface. Containers that join the pod share this namespace and
can reach each other on localhost.

List and remove pods:

```sh
sudo sdme pod ls
```

```sh
sudo sdme pod rm mypod
```

## Example: nginx and curl via --pod

The `--pod` flag puts the entire container into the pod's network
namespace. All processes inside the container share it.

Create a pod and two containers. We use the OCI nginx rootfs (from
the [OCI tutorial](@/tutorial/oci-apps.md)) since pod containers
only have loopback and cannot download packages.

```sh
sudo sdme pod new webpod
```

Start an nginx server in the pod:

```sh
sudo sdme create http-server -r nginx --pod webpod
sudo sdme start http-server
```

Start a client in the same pod and drop into a shell. The client
uses a host clone which already has curl:

```sh
sudo sdme new http-client --pod webpod
```

Inside the client, curl the server via localhost:

```sh
curl localhost
```

You should see the nginx welcome page. Both containers share the
same loopback interface.

You can see both containers and their pod association with:

```sh
sudo sdme ps
```

The POD column shows which pod each container belongs to.

### Limitations of --pod

Pod network namespaces only have a loopback interface. Containers
in a pod have no external connectivity: they cannot reach the
internet, download packages, or communicate with anything outside
the pod. Install any software you need before joining the pod, or
use pre-built OCI rootfs images.

`--pod` is also incompatible with `--userns`, `--hardened`, and
`--strict`. The kernel blocks `setns(CLONE_NEWNET)` across user
namespace boundaries. Use `--oci-pod` instead for hardened
containers.

## Example: redis via --oci-pod

The `--oci-pod` flag is for OCI application containers. Only the OCI
app service process enters the pod's network namespace; the
container's init and other services remain in their own namespace.

This works with `--hardened` and `--strict` because the network
namespace join happens inside the container's own namespace.

Create a pod and import redis:

```sh
sudo sdme pod new dbpod
```

```sh
sudo sdme fs import redis docker.io/redis --base-fs ubuntu
```

Start redis in the pod with hardened security:

```sh
sudo sdme create redis-server -r redis --oci-pod dbpod --hardened
sudo sdme start redis-server
```

Verify redis is running:

```sh
sudo sdme logs redis-server --oci
```

Start a client container in the same pod using the same redis
rootfs, so `redis-cli` is available. Both containers use
`--oci-pod` with `--hardened`:

```sh
sudo sdme create redis-client -r redis --oci-pod dbpod --hardened
sudo sdme start redis-client
```

Test the connection from the client:

```sh
sudo sdme exec redis-client --oci -- redis-cli ping
```

You should see `PONG`. Both containers share the pod's network
namespace and communicate over localhost, each running with
hardened security.

## --pod vs --oci-pod

<pre class="diagram">
Feature            --pod                  --oci-pod
-----------------  ---------------------  -------------------------
Scope              Entire container       OCI app service only
Container types    Any                    OCI app rootfs required
Userns/hardened    Incompatible           Compatible
Requires           (nothing extra)        --private-network or
                                          --hardened/--strict
Use case           General-purpose pods   Security-hardened apps
</pre>

Both flags can be used on different containers in the same pod.
The pod's network namespace is shared regardless of which flag
each container uses to join it.
