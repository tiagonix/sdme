# Running OCI Containers with sdme

## What sdme containers are

sdme creates systemd-booted containers using systemd-nspawn and
overlayfs. Each container runs its own systemd init, journal, and
D-Bus, managed as a regular systemd service on the host. There is no
daemon, no container runtime; just a single binary that talks to
systemd over D-Bus.

Containers are overlayfs clones of an imported root filesystem (or
your host system). The base rootfs stays read-only; all writes land
on a per-container upper layer.

## Base OS rootfs: development and infrastructure

Before getting into OCI apps, it helps to understand how sdme handles
base OS root filesystems. Importing a distro rootfs gives you a full
Linux environment with systemd, package managers, and all the tools
of that distro.

```bash
sudo sdme fs import debian docker.io/debian -v
sudo sdme fs import ubuntu docker.io/ubuntu:24.04 -v
sudo sdme fs import fedora quay.io/fedora/fedora -v
```

Each import produces a reusable rootfs. Create as many containers as
you want from it; each gets its own overlayfs upper layer.

```bash
sudo sdme new -r debian       # spin up a Debian container
sudo sdme new -r ubuntu       # spin up an Ubuntu container
sudo sdme new -r fedora       # spin up a Fedora container
```

### Why this matters

**Build systems.** Need a clean Ubuntu environment to build .deb
packages? Or a Fedora environment for RPMs? Import the rootfs, create
a container, `apt install` or `dnf install` whatever you need, as
root, without touching your host. Destroy the container when you're
done; the base rootfs is untouched.

```bash
sudo sdme new -r ubuntu builder
# inside the container:
apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential devscripts
# build your .deb, then exit
```

**Quick experiments.** Test a configuration change, try a new package,
run a service in isolation. Containers boot in seconds and cost almost
nothing (overlayfs means you only store the diff).

## OCI application images

This is where sdme gets interesting. OCI application images (nginx,
redis, mysql, postgresql, and anything else on Docker Hub, GHCR, or
Quay) can run inside sdme containers as systemd services, with no
container runtime dependency.

The idea: import a base OS rootfs that has systemd, then import an
OCI app image on top of it. sdme places the app rootfs under
`/oci/root` inside the base and generates a systemd service
(`sdme-oci-app.service`) that chroots into it and runs the app's
entrypoint.

You get the operational model of systemd (journalctl, systemctl,
resource limits, cgroups) with the packaging model of OCI (any
registry, any image).

### Two modes of import

When you `sdme fs import` an OCI registry image, sdme classifies it
as either a **base OS image** or an **application image**.

**Base OS images** (debian, ubuntu, fedora, etc.) have no entrypoint,
use a shell as their default command, and expose no ports. sdme
extracts the rootfs and installs systemd if it's missing. The result
is a first-class sdme rootfs.

**Application images** (nginx, redis, mysql, etc.) have an
entrypoint, a non-shell command, or exposed ports. sdme places the
application rootfs under `/oci/root` inside a copy of a base rootfs
you specify with `--base-fs`.

To avoid passing `--base-fs` every time, set a default:

```bash
sudo sdme config set default_base_fs ubuntu
```

The `--oci-mode` flag lets you override auto-detection:

| Flag                   | Behavior                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `--oci-mode=auto`      | Auto-detect from image config (default)        |
| `--oci-mode=base`      | Force base OS mode                             |
| `--oci-mode=app`       | Force application mode (requires `--base-fs`)  |

### Example: nginx on Ubuntu

Start by importing the base OS, then the app image:

```bash
sudo sdme fs import ubuntu docker.io/ubuntu:24.04 -v
sudo sdme fs import nginx docker.io/nginx --base-fs=ubuntu -v
```

sdme auto-detects nginx as an application image (it has an entrypoint
and exposes port 80). The imported rootfs is a copy of `ubuntu` with
the nginx OCI rootfs placed under `/oci/root/` and a systemd unit
generated.

Create and start:

```bash
sudo sdme new -r nginx
```

Once inside the container, verify the service is running:

```bash
systemctl status sdme-oci-app.service
curl -s http://localhost
```

You should see the nginx welcome page. Exit the container with
`logout` or Ctrl+D, then from the host:

```bash
# nginx listens on the host's network namespace by default
curl -s http://localhost
```

### Example: MySQL with runtime environment

MySQL needs `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` set at first boot. The OCI image
doesn't bake this in; it's a runtime variable.

```bash
sudo sdme fs import mysql docker.io/mysql --base-fs=ubuntu -v
```

The env file at `/oci/env` inside the rootfs contains the image's
built-in environment but not `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Add it before
creating a container:

```bash
echo 'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret' | sudo tee -a /var/lib/sdme/fs/mysql/oci/env
```

Now create and start:

```bash
sudo sdme new -r mysql
```

Once inside, check the service:

```bash
systemctl status sdme-oci-app.service
journalctl -u sdme-oci-app.service -f
```

Wait for the `ready for connections` log line, then test:

```bash
chroot /oci/root mysql -u root -psecret -e 'SELECT 1'
```

From the host (container shares the host network):

```bash
mysql -u root -psecret -h 127.0.0.1 -e 'SELECT 1'
```

## Pods: composing containers with shared networking

Pods give multiple containers a shared network namespace so they can
reach each other on localhost. The pattern is the same as Kubernetes
pods: one network namespace, multiple processes.

### Two mechanisms

**`--pod` (whole container):** The entire nspawn container (init,
services, everything) runs in the pod's network namespace. Works with
any rootfs type. Mutually exclusive with `--private-network`.

**`--oci-pod` (OCI app process only):** Only the
`sdme-oci-app.service` process enters the pod's network namespace.
The container's init and other services remain in their own namespace.
Requires an OCI app rootfs and `--private-network` (or `--hardened` /
`--strict`, which imply it).

Both flags can be combined on the same container. You can even point
them at the same pod (`--pod=X --oci-pod=X`).

### Basic pod example

Two containers sharing localhost:

```bash
sudo sdme pod new my-pod
sudo sdme new --pod=my-pod -r ubuntu db
sudo sdme new --pod=my-pod -r ubuntu app
# db and app can communicate via 127.0.0.1
```

### OCI app pod example

Run nginx in a pod and reach it from the host via the pod's netns:

```bash
sudo sdme fs import ubuntu docker.io/ubuntu:24.04 -v
sudo sdme fs import nginx docker.io/nginx --base-fs=ubuntu -v

sudo sdme pod new web-pod
sudo sdme new --oci-pod=web-pod --hardened -r nginx web

# from the host, reach nginx via the pod's netns
sudo nsenter --net=/run/sdme/pods/web-pod/netns curl -s http://localhost
```

### Scaling with pod groups

The composability of `--pod` and `--oci-pod` enables a layered
networking model for larger deployments:

**Groups of containers joined by a pod.** An administrator creates a
pod and assigns multiple containers to it. All containers in the
group share localhost, so services can discover each other by port
without any service mesh or DNS configuration.

```bash
# A database group: primary + replica sharing localhost
sudo sdme pod new db-group
sudo sdme new --pod=db-group -r ubuntu pg-primary
sudo sdme new --pod=db-group -r ubuntu pg-replica
```

**Multiple pod groups running different workloads.** Each pod group
is isolated from the others. You can run completely different sets of
OCI apps in separate pods, each with their own network namespace.

```bash
# Import OCI app images (assumes ubuntu base already imported)
sudo sdme fs import nginx docker.io/nginx --base-fs=ubuntu -v
sudo sdme fs import redis docker.io/redis --base-fs=ubuntu -v
sudo sdme fs import mysql docker.io/mysql --base-fs=ubuntu -v

# Web tier
sudo sdme pod new web-tier
sudo sdme new --oci-pod=web-tier --hardened -r nginx frontend
sudo sdme new --oci-pod=web-tier --hardened -r nginx api-gateway

# Data tier (separate pod, separate network)
sudo sdme pod new data-tier
sudo sdme new --oci-pod=data-tier --hardened -r redis cache
sudo sdme new --oci-pod=data-tier --hardened -r mysql db
```

Containers in `web-tier` can reach each other on localhost (nginx on
:80, api-gateway on :8080). Containers in `data-tier` can reach each
other on localhost (redis on :6379, mysql on :3306). The two tiers
are network-isolated.

**Combining `--pod` and `--oci-pod`.** When both flags are set on the
same container, the nspawn container itself runs in one pod's netns
while the OCI app process runs in another. This lets you build
topologies where the container-level networking (systemd services,
debugging tools) and the application-level networking (the actual
workload) operate in different network namespaces.

A simpler use case: set both to the same pod. This puts both the
container and the OCI app in the same network namespace, which is
equivalent to `--pod` alone but also wires up the inner
`NetworkNamespacePath=` drop-in.

```bash
# Both container and app share the same pod netns
sudo sdme pod new shared-pod
sudo sdme new --pod=shared-pod --oci-pod=shared-pod --hardened -r nginx web
```

### Pod management

```bash
sdme pod new my-pod          # create a pod
sdme pod ls                  # list pods
sdme pod rm my-pod           # remove (fails if containers reference it)
sdme pod rm -f my-pod        # force remove
```

## Security

OCI app containers should always be created with `--hardened` or
`--strict`. These flags enable user namespace isolation, private
network, and capability restrictions. `--oci-pod` requires
`--hardened` or `--strict` (or at minimum `--private-network`).

See [security.md](security.md) for the full details on hardening
flags and comparisons with Docker and Podman.

## Volume mounts

OCI images declare volumes in their image config (e.g. mysql declares
`/var/lib/mysql`). sdme reads these from the `/oci/volumes` file in
the rootfs and auto-creates persistent bind mounts when creating a
container.

### How it works

When you create a container from an OCI app rootfs, sdme checks for
`/oci/volumes` in the rootfs. For each declared volume:

1. A host-side directory is created at
   `{datadir}/volumes/{container}/{volume-name}` (e.g.
   `/var/lib/sdme/volumes/mydb/var-lib-mysql`)
2. A bind mount is added mapping the host dir to
   `/oci/root{volume-path}` inside the container

```bash
# mysql declares /var/lib/mysql; sdme auto-mounts it
sudo sdme create -r mysql
# equivalent to:
# sudo sdme create -r mysql --bind /var/lib/sdme/volumes/{name}/var-lib-mysql:/oci/root/var/lib/mysql
```

### Data persistence

Volume data survives container removal. When you `sdme rm` a
container that has OCI volumes, sdme prints the volume data location
but does not delete it:

```
volume data retained at /var/lib/sdme/volumes/mydb/
```

To reclaim disk space, manually remove the volume directory:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/sdme/volumes/mydb/
```

### Opting out

Use `--no-oci-volumes` to suppress auto-mounting:

```bash
sudo sdme create -r mysql --no-oci-volumes
```

### Manual override

User `--bind` flags take priority. If you bind-mount to the same
container path that an OCI volume targets, the auto-mount is skipped:

```bash
# Use a custom host path for mysql data
sudo sdme create -r mysql --bind /srv/mysql-data:/oci/root/var/lib/mysql
```

## Port forwarding

OCI images declare exposed ports in their image config (e.g. nginx
exposes 80/tcp, mysql exposes 3306/tcp). sdme reads these from the
`/oci/ports` file in the rootfs and auto-forwards them when creating
a container with a private network namespace.

### How it works

When you create a container from an OCI app rootfs, sdme checks for
`/oci/ports` in the rootfs. If ports are declared and the container
uses a private network namespace, sdme automatically adds `--port`
rules mapping each OCI port to the same host port:

```bash
# nginx exposes 80/tcp; sdme auto-forwards it
sudo sdme create -r nginx --private-network --network-veth
# equivalent to: sudo sdme create -r nginx --private-network --network-veth --port tcp:80:80
```

Port forwarding uses systemd-nspawn's `--port` flag, which requires a
virtual ethernet pair (`--network-veth`, `--network-bridge`, or
`--network-zone`) to route traffic between host and container. Using
`--private-network` alone creates an isolated loopback-only network
with no path for forwarded packets.

The container must also have `systemd-networkd` enabled so the
container-side interface (`host0`) gets configured via DHCP. Most
imported distro rootfs have the networkd config files installed
(`80-container-host0.network`) but the service disabled by default.
Enable it before first boot:

```bash
# Enable networkd in the overlayfs upper layer
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service \
    /var/lib/sdme/containers/<name>/upper/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/systemd-networkd.service
```

### Network modes

**Private network with veth** (`--private-network --network-veth`):
OCI ports are auto-forwarded. The host port matches the container
port (e.g. `tcp:80:80`). User `--port` flags take priority; if you
specify `--port tcp:8080:80`, the auto-forward for port 80 is
skipped. Traffic reaches the container through a virtual ethernet pair
with NAT rules managed by systemd-nspawn. Curl the host-side veth IP
(not localhost) to reach forwarded ports; systemd-nspawn's nft rules
exclude 127.0.0.0/8 from DNAT in the output chain.

**Host network** (default, no `--private-network`): Services bind
directly to the host's interfaces, so no forwarding is needed. sdme
prints an informational message listing the exposed ports.

**Pod networking** (`--pod`): The container runs in the pod's
network namespace. Ports are accessible from other containers in the
same pod via localhost. No auto-forwarding is applied since there is
no private network namespace.

**Hardened/strict** (`--hardened`, `--strict`): These enable
`--private-network` (triggering auto-forwarding in the state file),
but do not add `--network-veth`. The ports are stored in the
container's state but cannot be reached from the host without also
adding `--network-veth`.

### Opting out

Use `--no-oci-ports` to suppress auto-forwarding:

```bash
sudo sdme create -r nginx --private-network --network-veth --no-oci-ports
```

### Manual override

User `--port` flags always take priority. To map a different host
port:

```bash
# Map host port 8080 to container port 80
sudo sdme create -r nginx --private-network --network-veth --port tcp:8080:80 --no-oci-ports
```

## Limitations

- **One OCI service per container.** Each imported rootfs generates a
  single `sdme-oci-app.service`. Running multiple OCI services in one
  container isn't supported by the import flow (but you could
  manually set it up).

- **Environment variables need manual setup.** Runtime-only variables
  like `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` must be added to `/oci/env` in the
  rootfs or the container's overlayfs upper layer before first boot.

- **No health checks.** OCI HEALTHCHECK directives are ignored.

- **No restart policy mapping.** OCI restart policies don't map to
  systemd; the generated unit uses systemd defaults. Edit the unit if
  you need `Restart=always` or similar.
