# sdme: Architecture and Design

**Alexandre Fiori, February 2026**

## 1. Introduction

sdme is a container manager for Linux. It runs on top of systemd-nspawn
and overlayfs, both already present on any modern systemd-based
distribution.

No daemon, no runtime dependency beyond systemd itself. A single static
binary that manages overlayfs layering and drives systemd over D-Bus.

The project started as an experiment inspired by virtme-ng: what if you
could clone your running host system into an isolated container with a
single command? Overlayfs makes this nearly free: mount the host rootfs
as a read-only lower layer, give the container its own upper layer for
writes, and you have a full-featured Linux environment that shares the
host's binaries but can't damage the host's files. That was the seed.

From there it grew: importing rootfs from other distros, pulling OCI
images from Docker Hub, building custom root filesystems, managing
container lifecycle through D-Bus. Each piece turned out to be
surprisingly tractable when you let claude (and systemd) do the heavy
lifting.

sdme is not an attempt to replace Podman, Docker, or any other container
runtime. Podman in particular has excellent systemd integration through
Quadlet (podman-systemd). It is today's mature, full-featured approach
to systemd-native container management. sdme is a different thing
entirely. It boots full systemd inside nspawn containers, manages
overlayfs layering directly, and bridges the OCI ecosystem, all without
a daemon and without pulling in a container runtime.

You get the operational model of systemd (journalctl, systemctl,
resource limits) with the packaging model of OCI (Docker Hub, GHCR,
Quay).

The name stands for *Systemd Machine Editor*, and its pronunciation is
left as an exercise for the reader.

## 2. Dev Mode: Cloning Your Host

The foundational mode of sdme is what you get when you run `sdme new`
with no flags. It creates a container that is an overlayfs clone of your
running host system: same kernel, same binaries, same libraries, but
with its own writable layer so changes stay isolated.

```

  |  +----------------------+  +----------------------+  |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

  Note: /etc/systemd/system and /var/log are opaque
  by default -- the container sees empty directories
  there, not the host's units and logs.
```

Looks like this:

```
$ sudo sdme new
creating 'jerinhouma'
starting 'jerinhouma'
joining 'jerinhouma'
host rootfs container: joining as user 'fiorix' with opaque dirs /etc/systemd/system, /var/log
Connected to machine jerinhouma. Press ^] three times within 1s to exit session.
jerinhouma ~ $ systemctl status
● jerinhouma
    State: running
    Units: 185 loaded (incl. loaded aliases)
     Jobs: 0 queued
   Failed: 0 units
    Since: Thu 2026-02-26 01:15:38 GMT; 7s ago
  systemd: 257.9-0ubuntu2.1
...
```

Each container boots its own systemd instance inside the nspawn
namespace. The host's systemd manages the container as a service unit;
the container's systemd manages everything inside. Both talk to their
own D-Bus, both write to their own journal, but the container's writes
land on the overlayfs upper layer and never touch the host - well,
except that they are stored on the host. This matters, and the details
are explained in Section 14.

**User identity preservation.** When sdme is run via `sudo` and the
container is a host-rootfs clone (no `-r` flag), it reads `$SUDO_USER`
and joins the container as that user rather than root. This is a
convenience for landing on your own machine as your own user: your own
`$HOME`, dotfiles, shell, etc. The behaviour is controlled by the
`join_as_sudo_user` config setting (enabled by default) and can be
disabled with `sdme config set join_as_sudo_user no`.

**Opaque directories** are the key to making host clones usable.
Without them, the container would inherit the host's systemd units and
try to start all the same services. By default, sdme marks
`/etc/systemd/system` and `/var/log` as overlayfs-opaque (via the
`trusted.overlay.opaque` xattr), making the container see empty
directories there. The host's units and logs are hidden; the container
starts clean.

**DNS** requires special treatment because containers share the host's
network namespace by default. The host's `systemd-resolved` already
owns `127.0.0.53`, so the container's copy would fail to bind. For
imported rootfs, sdme masks `systemd-resolved` directly in the rootfs
during `sdme fs import`. For host-rootfs containers (no `-r`), the mask
goes in the overlayfs upper layer during `create`. Either way, the mask
is a symlink to `/dev/null` in `/etc/systemd/system/`. This causes the
container's NSS `resolve` module to return UNAVAIL, falling through to
the `dns` module which reads `/etc/resolv.conf`. A placeholder regular
file is written there so `systemd-nspawn --resolv-conf=auto` can
populate it at boot.

## 3. The Catalogue

Everything sdme knows lives under `/var/lib/sdme` (the default
`datadir`, configurable via `sdme config set datadir <path>`):

```
  /var/lib/sdme/
  |-- state/
  |   |-- container-a          # KEY=VALUE metadata
  |   +-- container-b
  |-- containers/
  |   |-- container-a/
  |   |   |-- upper/           # CoW writes
  |   |   |-- work/            # overlayfs workdir
  |   |   +-- merged/          # mount point
  |   +-- container-b/
  |       +-- ...
  |-- fs/
  |   |-- ubuntu/              # imported rootfs
  |   |-- fedora/
  |   |-- nginx/               # OCI app rootfs
  |   +-- .ubuntu.meta         # distro metadata
  |-- volumes/
  |   +-- my-container/
  |       |-- var-lib-mysql/   # OCI-declared volume data
  |       +-- data/
  +-- pods/
      +-- my-pod/
          +-- state            # KEY=VALUE pod state (CREATED=...)
```

Pod runtime state (volatile, recreated after reboot):

```
  /run/sdme/pods/
  +-- my-pod/
      +-- netns                # bind-mount of the pod's netns fd
```

**State files** are flat KEY=VALUE text files under `state/`. They
record everything about a container: name, rootfs, creation timestamp,
resource limits, network configuration, bind mounts, environment
variables, opaque directories, and pod membership (`POD` and/or
`OCI_POD`). The format is intentionally simple: readable with `cat`,
parseable with `grep`, editable with `sed` in an emergency. The `State`
type in the code uses a `BTreeMap<String, String>` for deterministic
key ordering.

**Transactional operations** follow a staging pattern throughout sdme.
Rootfs imports write to a `.{name}.importing` staging directory, then
do an atomic `rename()` to the final path on success. If the import
fails or is interrupted, the staging directory is cleaned up, and if
it's left behind (power failure, OOM kill), the next import detects it
and offers to clean up with `--force`.

**Health detection** in `sdme ps` checks that a container's expected
directories actually exist and that its rootfs (if specified) is
present. A container whose rootfs has been removed shows as `broken`.
OS detection reads `/etc/os-release` from the rootfs to show distro
names in the listing.

**Conflict detection** checks three places before accepting a name: the
sdme state directory, `/var/lib/machines/` (systemd's own machine
directory), and the list of currently registered machines via D-Bus.
This prevents collisions with both sdme containers and any other nspawn
machines on the system.

## 4. Container Lifecycle

```
  create --> start --> join/exec --> stop --> rm
    |           |                     |       |
    |     install/update         graceful: KillMachine SIGRTMIN+4
    |     template unit          --term:   TerminateMachine
    |     StartUnit (D-Bus)      --kill:   KillMachine SIGKILL
    |     wait for boot
    |
    +-- mkdir upper/ work/ merged/
    +-- mask systemd-resolved (host-rootfs only; imported rootfs patched at import)
    +-- write /etc/resolv.conf placeholder
    +-- set opaque dirs (xattr)
    +-- write state file
```

**create** builds the overlayfs directory structure, sets up DNS,
applies opaque directories, validates the umask (a restrictive umask
would make overlayfs files inaccessible to non-root services like
dbus-daemon), and writes the state file. It does not start the
container.

**start** installs (or updates) a systemd template unit and
per-container drop-in, then calls `StartUnit` over D-Bus. After the
unit starts, sdme waits for the container to reach the `running` state
by subscribing to `machined` D-Bus signals and polling the machine
state. The boot timeout defaults to 60 seconds and is configurable.

**join** and **exec** spawn `machinectl shell` as a child process and
forward its exit status. This was a deliberate choice: machinectl
handles the namespace entry, PAM session setup, and environment
correctly, and reimplementing that logic in Rust would buy nothing.
Spawning (rather than exec'ing) keeps sdme alive so it can inspect the
exit code and clean up on failure (particularly important for `sdme
new`, which removes the container if the join fails). The balance struck
is: use D-Bus where it gives us programmatic control (start, stop,
status queries), shell out where the existing tool already does the job
well (interactive shell sessions, running commands).

**stop** has three tiers: graceful (default) sends `SIGRTMIN+4` to the
container leader via `KillMachine` (90s timeout), `--term` calls
`TerminateMachine` which sends SIGTERM to the nspawn process (30s
timeout), and `--kill` sends SIGKILL to all processes via `KillMachine`
(15s timeout). Multiple containers can be stopped in one invocation.

**rm** stops the container if running, removes the state file, and
deletes the container's directories. The `make_removable()` helper
recursively fixes permissions before deletion, since containers can
create files owned by arbitrary UIDs with restrictive modes, and
`remove_dir_all()` would fail without this.

**Boot failure cleanup** differs between `sdme new` and `sdme start`.
If `sdme new` fails to boot or join the container (or is interrupted
with Ctrl+C), it removes the just-created container entirely (the user
never asked for a stopped container, they asked for a running one). If
`sdme start` fails, it stops the container but preserves it on disk for
debugging.

## 5. Container Names

When you don't specify a name, sdme generates one from a wordlist of
200 Tupi-Guarani words and variations. The choice is an easter egg, a
nod to the indigenous languages of Brazil - our roots!

Name generation shuffles the wordlist (Fisher-Yates, seeded from
`/dev/urandom`), checks each candidate against the three-way conflict
detection (state files, `/var/lib/machines/`, registered machines), and
returns the first unused name. If all 200 base words are taken, it
falls back to vowel mutations: consonants stay fixed while vowels are
randomly substituted, producing names that sound like plausible
Tupi-Guarani words but don't appear in the original list. Up to 200
mutation attempts before giving up. Sorry folks yet I digress,
inspiration from MF-DOOM makes me handle these nerdy things just like
chess.

## 6. The fs Subsystem: Managing Root Filesystems

The `fs` subsystem manages the catalogue of root filesystems that
containers are built from. Each rootfs is a plain directory under
`/var/lib/sdme/fs/` containing a complete Linux filesystem tree.
Containers reference them by name.

### Import sources

`sdme fs import` auto-detects the source type by probing in order:

- **URL** -- `http://` or `https://` prefix. Downloads the file, then
  extracts as a tarball.
- **OCI registry** -- looks like a domain with a path
  (e.g. `docker.io/ubuntu:24.04`, `quay.io/fedora/fedora`). Pulled via
  the OCI Distribution Spec.
- **Directory** -- path is a directory. Copied with `copy_tree()`
  preserving ownership, permissions, xattrs, and special files.
- **QCOW2 image** -- magic bytes `QFI\xfb` at the start of the file.
  Mounted read-only via `qemu-nbd`, then copied with `copy_tree()`.
- **Raw disk image** -- MBR/GPT signature or `.raw`/`.img` extension.
  Same `qemu-nbd` path as QCOW2.
- **Tarball** -- default fallback for any other file. Extracted with
  native Rust crates; compression is detected from magic bytes, not the
  file name.

### The hard parts

**Permissions and ownership** must be preserved exactly. A rootfs
contains files owned by dozens of system UIDs (root, messagebus,
systemd-network, nobody, etc.) with specific modes. The `copy_tree()`
function uses `lchown()` for ownership, `chmod()` for permissions, and
`utimensat()` with nanosecond precision for timestamps. All operations
use `l`-prefixed variants (lstat, lchown, lgetxattr) to avoid following
symlinks.

**Extended attributes** carry security and filesystem metadata.
`copy_xattrs()` lists and copies all xattrs except `security.selinux`
(which doesn't transfer meaningfully between filesystems). The overlayfs
`trusted.overlay.opaque` xattr is preserved when present.

**Special files** (block devices, character devices, FIFOs, and Unix
sockets) are recreated with `mknod()` and `mkfifo()` using the original
mode and device numbers. This matters for rootfs that include
`/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, and friends.

**Compression auto-detection** uses magic bytes rather than file
extensions. The first few bytes of a file reveal its compression format:

| Magic bytes            | Format |
|------------------------|--------|
| `1f 8b`                | gzip   |
| `BZh`                  | bzip2  |
| `fd 37 7a 58 5a 00`   | xz     |
| `28 b5 2f fd`          | zstd   |

This means `sdme fs import ubuntu rootfs.tar.zst` works even if the
file is named `rootfs.tar`, because the content, not the name,
determines the decompressor.

**Systemd detection** runs after import. If the rootfs doesn't contain
systemd and dbus (both required for nspawn containers), sdme can install
them automatically: it detects the distro family from `/etc/os-release`
and runs the appropriate package manager (`apt`, `dnf`) in a chroot.
The `--install-packages` flag controls this: `auto` prompts
interactively, `yes` always installs, `no` refuses if systemd is
absent.

**Rootfs patching** runs after systemd detection. Even when systemd is
present, sdme patches the rootfs for nspawn compatibility:
`systemd-resolved` is masked (containers share the host's network
namespace and cannot bind 127.0.0.53), `systemd-logind` is unmasked if
masked (some OCI images like CentOS/AlmaLinux mask it, but
`machinectl shell` requires logind), and missing packages needed by
`machinectl shell` (e.g. `util-linux` and `pam` on RHEL-family, which
provide `/etc/pam.d/login`) are installed via chroot. These patches are
applied directly to the rootfs so all containers created from it inherit
a working environment without overlayfs-level fixups.

**Staging areas and atomic operations** ensure that a failed import
doesn't leave a half-written rootfs. The staging directory
`.{name}.importing` is renamed to the final location only on complete
success. If sdme finds a leftover staging directory on the next run, it
reports it and the `--force` flag cleans it up.

**Cooperative Ctrl+C** runs throughout the import pipeline. A global
`INTERRUPTED` flag is set by a POSIX signal handler (installed with
`sigaction`, deliberately without `SA_RESTART` so blocking reads return
`EINTR`). The import loop checks this flag between operations, allowing
clean cancellation of multi-gigabyte downloads and extractions.

## 7. fs build: Building Root Filesystems

`sdme fs build` takes a Dockerfile-like config and produces a new
rootfs:

```
FROM ubuntu
COPY ./my-app /opt/my-app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libssl3
RUN systemctl enable my-app.service
```

The build engine creates a staging container from the FROM rootfs, then
processes operations sequentially. The key insight is that COPY and RUN
have different requirements:

- **COPY** writes directly to the overlayfs upper layer while the
  container is stopped. This is a filesystem operation; no running
  container needed.
- **RUN** executes a command inside the container via
  `machinectl shell`. The container must be running.

The engine starts and stops the container as needed: if it encounters a
RUN after a COPY, it starts the container; if it encounters a COPY
after a RUN, it stops it first. This means a config with alternating
COPY and RUN operations will start and stop the container multiple
times, but in practice most configs group their COPYs at the top and
RUNs at the bottom.

**Path sanitisation** rejects COPY destinations under directories that
systemd mounts tmpfs over at boot (`/tmp`, `/run`, `/dev/shm`). Files
written to the overlayfs upper layer in these locations would be hidden
by the tmpfs mount when the container starts, a silent data loss that's
hard to debug. Destinations under overlayfs-opaque directories are also
rejected. Errors include the config file path and line number for easy
debugging.

After all operations complete, the engine mounts the overlayfs manually
(the container is stopped), copies the merged view to a staging rootfs
directory, and does an atomic rename to the final location. The staging
container is cleaned up regardless of success or failure.

## 8. OCI Integration

> *The goal isn't to replace Docker or Podman. It's to give systemd-nspawn users
> a way to tap into the OCI ecosystem without leaving the systemd operational
> model.*

### Learning the spec

OCI registry pulling implements the OCI Distribution Spec directly, no
shelling out. The flow is: parse the image reference, probe the registry
for auth requirements, obtain a bearer token if needed, fetch the
manifest (resolving manifest lists by architecture), then download and
extract layers in order.

Layer extraction handles OCI whiteout markers: `.wh.<name>` deletes a
file from the previous layer, `.wh..wh..opq` clears an entire
directory. Tar paths are sanitised (leading `/` is stripped and `..`
components are rejected) to prevent path traversal escaping the
destination directory.

### Two modes: base OS and application

When importing an OCI image, sdme classifies it as either a **base OS
image** or an **application image** based on the image config: presence
of an entrypoint, non-shell default command, or exposed ports indicate
an application.

**Base OS import** (debian, ubuntu, fedora) is straightforward: extract
the rootfs and install systemd if missing. The result is a first-class
sdme rootfs.

**Application import** produces what sdme calls a *capsule*: a copy of
a base OS rootfs with the OCI application rootfs placed under
`/oci/root` and a generated systemd service unit that chroots into it.

```

  +------------------------------------------------------+
```

The generated `sdme-oci-app.service` unit uses
`RootDirectory=/oci/root` to chroot the process, `MountAPIVFS=yes` to
provide `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, and `EnvironmentFile=-/oci/env` to
load the image's environment variables. The unit is enabled via symlink
in `multi-user.target.wants/` so it starts automatically when the
container boots.

The capsule model means OCI applications get the full systemd
operational model for free: `journalctl -u sdme-oci-app` for logs,
`systemctl restart` for restarts, cgroup resource limits from the host.
The application doesn't know or care that it's inside an nspawn
container; it sees a chroot with API filesystems, exactly what it
expects.

### Privilege dropping for non-root OCI users

Many OCI application images declare a non-root `User` in their config
(e.g. `nginx` runs as UID 101). systemd's `User=` directive resolves
usernames via NSS **before** entering the `RootDirectory=` chroot, so
users that only exist inside the OCI rootfs cause exit code 217/USER.
This is a known upstream limitation (see
[systemd#12498](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/12498),
[systemd#19781](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19781)).

sdme solves this with a generated static ELF binary (`drop_privs`,
under 1 KiB) that performs `setgroups(0,NULL)` then `setgid` then
`setuid` then `chdir` then `execve`, all via raw syscalls with no libc
or NSS dependency. The binary is written to `/.sdme-drop-privs` inside
the OCI root at import time (mode `0o111`, owned by root). For non-root
users the generated unit becomes:

```ini
ExecStart=/.sdme-drop-privs <uid> <gid> <workdir> <entrypoint> [args...]
```

No `User=` or `WorkingDirectory=` directives are needed; the binary
handles both. For root users, the standard `User=root` unit is generated
unchanged.

The OCI `User` field is resolved at import time against `etc/passwd`
and `etc/group` inside the OCI rootfs, supporting named users, numeric
UIDs, explicit groups, and `uid:gid` pairs. Full details in
[docs/hacks.md](hacks.md).

### /dev/std* shim for journal socket compatibility

OCI images commonly symlink log files to `/dev/stdout` or
`/dev/stderr` (e.g. `/var/log/nginx/error.log -> /dev/stderr ->
/proc/self/fd/2`). Under Docker, fds 1/2 are pipes, so `open()` on
`/proc/self/fd/N` succeeds. Under systemd, fds 1/2 are journal
sockets, and the kernel rejects `open()` on socket-backed
`/proc/self/fd/N` with ENXIO.

sdme solves this with a generated LD_PRELOAD shared library
(`devfd_shim`, approximately 4 KiB) that intercepts
`open()`/`openat()` at the libc symbol level. When the path matches
`/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`, `/dev/fd/{0,1,2}`, or
`/proc/self/fd/{0,1,2}`, the interceptor returns `dup(N)` instead of
calling the real `open`. All other paths fall through to the real
syscall.

The shim is written to `/.sdme-devfd-shim.so` inside the OCI root at
import time, and the generated unit includes
`Environment=LD_PRELOAD=/.sdme-devfd-shim.so`. This applies to all OCI
containers (both root and non-root users). Full details in
[docs/hacks.md](hacks.md).

### OCI plumbing: ports and volumes

OCI images declare exposed ports and volumes in their image config.
sdme reads these from `/oci/ports` and `/oci/volumes` in the rootfs
and auto-wires them at container creation time.

**Port forwarding.** When the container uses a private network namespace
(`--private-network`, `--hardened`, or `--strict`), sdme reads
`/oci/ports` and adds `--port` rules mapping each declared port to the
same host port. User `--port` flags take priority; matching ports are
skipped. On host-network containers, no forwarding is needed (services
bind directly to the host), so sdme prints an informational message
instead. Suppressed with `--no-oci-ports`.

**Volume mounts.** For each volume declared in `/oci/volumes`, sdme
creates a host-side directory at
`{datadir}/volumes/{container}/{volume-name}` and adds a bind mount
mapping it to `/oci/root{volume-path}` inside the container. Volume
data survives container removal (sdme prints the path but does not
delete it). User `--bind` flags take priority: if the user binds to the
same container path, the auto-mount is skipped. Suppressed with
`--no-oci-volumes`.

**Remaining caveat.** User-specified bind mounts (`-b`) and environment
variables (`-e`) on the container operate at the nspawn level, not
inside the `RootDirectory=/oci/root` chroot where the OCI application
runs. OCI-declared volumes and ports are handled correctly because sdme
maps volumes into the `/oci/root` subtree and ports operate at the
network namespace level.

### Future direction

At this point this is all very exploratory. This journey is 1% complete.

## 9. Networking

By default, containers share the host's network namespace: same
interfaces, same addresses, same ports. This is the simplest mode and
what you get with `sdme new` out of the box.

For isolation, `--private-network` gives the container its own network
namespace with no connectivity. The remaining network flags build on
top of it and all imply `--private-network` automatically:

- `--private-network`: isolated network namespace, no connectivity
- `--network-veth`: creates a virtual ethernet link between host and
  container
- `--network-bridge <name>`: connects the container's veth to a host
  bridge
- `--network-zone <name>`: joins a named zone for inter-container
  networking
- `--port / -p <[PROTO:]HOST[:CONTAINER]>`: forwards a port (TCP by
  default, repeatable)

These flags are available on both `sdme create` and `sdme new`. They
compose freely: you can combine `--network-zone` with `--port`, or use
`--network-bridge` with `--network-veth`. Port forwarding requires a
private network namespace because systemd-nspawn's `--port` flag only
works when host and container have separate network stacks.

Under the hood, each flag translates directly to a systemd-nspawn
argument. The network configuration is persisted in the container's
state file (`PRIVATE_NETWORK`, `NETWORK_VETH`, `NETWORK_BRIDGE`,
`NETWORK_ZONE`, `PORTS`) and written into the per-container nspawn
drop-in at start time.

Bridge and zone names are validated (alphanumeric, hyphens,
underscores). Port specs are validated for format
(`[PROTO:]HOST[:CONTAINER]`) and range (1-65535).

## 10. Pods

Pods give multiple containers a shared network namespace so they can
reach each other on localhost. The pattern is the same as Kubernetes
pods: one network namespace, multiple containers.

There are two mechanisms for joining a pod, serving different use cases:

**`--pod` (whole-container):** The entire nspawn container runs in the
pod's network namespace. All processes (init, services, everything)
share the pod's network stack. This is the general-purpose option for
any container type.

**`--oci-pod` (OCI app only):** The pod's netns is bind-mounted into
the container and only the OCI app service process enters it via a
systemd `NetworkNamespacePath=` drop-in. The container's init and other
services remain in their own network namespace. This is for OCI app
containers that need pod networking for their application process but
want systemd's own networking to remain independent. Requires an OCI
app rootfs.

Both flags can be combined on the same container (e.g.
`--pod=X --oci-pod=Y` with different pods).

```
  --pod (whole container in pod netns):

  +------------------------------------------------------+
  |                     HOST SYSTEM                      |
  |         kernel . systemd . D-Bus . machined          |
  |                                                      |
  |   /run/sdme/pods/my-pod/netns  (netns bind-mount)    |
  |          |                                           |
  |          |  +-- loopback only (127.0.0.1) --+        |
  |          |  |                               |        |
  |    +-----+----------+   +------------------+--+      |
  |    | container A     |   | container B        |      |
  |    | (db :5432)      |   | (app :8080)        |      |
  |    | nspawn --network|   | nspawn --network   |      |
  |    |  -namespace-    |   |  -namespace-       |      |
  |    |  path=pod-netns |   |  path=pod-netns    |      |
  |    +-----------------+   +--------------------+      |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

  Both containers see 127.0.0.1:5432 (db) and
  127.0.0.1:8080 (app) because they share the netns.
```

### Lifecycle

`sdme pod new <name>` creates the pod:

1. Validates the name (same rules as container names).
2. Calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWNET)` to create a new network namespace.
3. Brings up the loopback interface (`ioctl SIOCSIFFLAGS IFF_UP`).
4. Bind-mounts `/proc/self/ns/net` to
   `/run/sdme/pods/<name>/netns`.
5. Restores the original network namespace via `setns()`.
6. Writes a persistent state file at
   `{datadir}/pods/<name>/state`.

The runtime bind-mount under `/run` is volatile and disappears on
reboot. When a container referencing a pod is started,
`ensure_runtime()` checks whether the bind-mount still exists and
recreates the netns if needed.

`sdme pod ls` lists all pods with their active/inactive status.

`sdme pod rm <name>` unmounts the netns, removes the runtime directory,
and deletes the persistent state directory. Removal is refused if any
container still references the pod via `POD` or `OCI_POD` keys
(override with `--force`).

### Container integration

**`--pod=<name>`** on `sdme create` or `sdme new`:

- Works with any container type (host-rootfs or imported rootfs).
- Incompatible with `--userns` and `--hardened`: the kernel blocks
  `setns(CLONE_NEWNET)` from a child user namespace into the pod's
  netns (owned by the init userns). Use `--oci-pod` for hardened pods.
- Compatible with `--private-network` (without userns): the pod's
  netns already provides equivalent isolation (loopback only), so
  `--private-network` is automatically omitted from the nspawn
  invocation when a pod is used.
- Stores `POD=<name>` in the container's state file.
- At start time, the nspawn drop-in includes
  `--network-namespace-path=/run/sdme/pods/<name>/netns`, which makes
  the entire container (including init and all services) run inside
  the pod's network namespace.

**`--oci-pod=<name>`** on `sdme create` or `sdme new`:

- Requires an OCI app rootfs (`sdme-oci-app.service` must exist in the
  rootfs).
- Stores `OCI_POD=<name>` in the container's state file.
- At create time, writes a systemd drop-in inside the overlayfs upper
  layer at
  `upper/etc/systemd/system/sdme-oci-app.service.d/oci-pod-netns.conf`
  with `NetworkNamespacePath=/run/sdme/oci-pod-netns`.
- At start time, the nspawn drop-in includes
  `--bind-ro=/run/sdme/pods/<name>/netns:/run/sdme/oci-pod-netns`,
  which makes the pod's netns available inside the container. The
  inner drop-in makes only the OCI app service process enter the
  pod's netns.

`sdme ps` shows a POD column when any container has a `--pod`
assignment, an OCI-POD column when any container has an `--oci-pod`
assignment, a USERNS column when any container has `--userns` enabled,
and a BINDS column when any container has bind mounts configured.

### Isolation properties

The pod netns contains only a loopback interface with no routes.
Containers in the pod can communicate via localhost but have no external
connectivity unless a veth or bridge is added to the netns externally.

Inside the container, systemd-nspawn's default capability set drops
`CAP_NET_ADMIN`, so the container's root cannot add interfaces or
change routes in the shared netns. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is present
(required by systemd inside nspawn) but the container's PID namespace
prevents access to host process netns references. The OCI app process
itself (running as a non-root UID) has zero effective capabilities.

## 11. Resource Limits

sdme exposes three cgroup-based resource controls:

| Flag                     | systemd property | Example                                |
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--memory <size>`        | `MemoryMax=`     | `--memory 2G`                          |
| `--cpus <count>`         | `CPUQuota=`      | `--cpus 0.5` (50%), `--cpus 2` (200%) |
| `--cpu-weight <1-10000>` | `CPUWeight=`     | `--cpu-weight 100`                     |

These flags are available on `sdme create`, `sdme new`, and `sdme set`.
They are applied via a systemd drop-in file (`limits.conf`) installed
alongside the container's service unit. A `daemon-reload` is triggered
when the drop-in changes.

`sdme set` replaces all limits at once: flags not specified are removed.
If the container is running, sdme prints a note that a restart is needed
for the new limits to take effect.

Memory values accept K/M/G/T suffixes. CPU count is a positive float
where `1` means one full core and `0.5` means half a core (converted to
systemd's `CPUQuota=` percentage internally). CPU weight is an integer
from 1 to 10000, controlling relative scheduling priority when CPUs are
contended.

## 12. Bind Mounts and Environment Variables

Custom bind mounts and environment variables are set at creation time
with `-b`/`--bind` and `-e`/`--env`, available on both `sdme create`
and `sdme new`.

**Bind mounts** use the format `HOST:CONTAINER[:ro]`. Read-write is the
default; append `:ro` for read-only. Both paths must be absolute with
no `..` components, and the host path must exist at creation time. At
start time, each bind becomes a `--bind=` or `--bind-ro=` argument to
systemd-nspawn.

**Environment variables** use the format `KEY=VALUE`. Keys must be
alphanumeric or underscore (no leading digit). At start time, each
variable becomes a `--setenv=KEY=VALUE` argument to systemd-nspawn.

Both are stored in the container's state file (`BINDS=` and `ENVS=`,
pipe-separated) and reconstituted into nspawn arguments on every start.

## 13. Configuration

sdme stores its settings in a TOML file at `~/.config/sdme/sdmerc`:

| Setting                   | Default                        | Description                                                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `interactive`             | `true`                         | Enable interactive prompts                                             |
| `datadir`                 | `/var/lib/sdme`                | Root directory for all container and rootfs data                       |
| `boot_timeout`            | `60`                           | Seconds to wait for container boot before giving up                    |
| `join_as_sudo_user`       | `true`                         | Join host-rootfs containers as `$SUDO_USER` instead of root            |
| `host_rootfs_opaque_dirs` | `/etc/systemd/system,/var/log` | Default opaque dirs for host-rootfs containers (empty string disables) |

Settings are read with `sdme config get` and written with
`sdme config set <key> <value>`.

**Sudo interplay.** Since sdme runs as root via `sudo`, the config file
lookup checks whether `$SUDO_USER` is set to a non-root user. If so,
and if that user's `~/.config/sdme/sdmerc` exists, it is used instead
of root's config. This means the invoking user's preferences are
respected without requiring the config to live under `/root`. An
explicit `-c`/`--config` flag overrides all resolution logic.

Config files are written with mode `0600` and directories with mode
`0700`.

## 14. Security

For a comprehensive analysis of sdme's isolation model, including
namespace isolation, capability bounding sets, seccomp filtering,
AppArmor, and comparisons with Docker and Podman, see
[docs/security.md](security.md).

This section covers input sanitization for untrusted data.

sdme runs as root and handles untrusted input: tarballs from the
internet, OCI images from public registries, QCOW2 disk images from
unknown sources. Several hardening measures are in place:

**Path traversal prevention.** OCI layer tar paths are sanitised before
extraction: `..` components are rejected and leading `/` is stripped.
Whiteout marker handling verifies (via `canonicalize()`) that the target
path stays within the destination directory before deleting anything.

**Digest validation.** OCI blob digests (`sha256:abc123...`) are
validated for safe characters (alphanumeric and hex only) and correct
length (64 chars for SHA-256, 128 for SHA-512) before being used to
construct filesystem paths. A malicious manifest cannot use the digest
field for directory traversal.

**Download size cap.** URL downloads are capped at 50 GiB
(`MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE`), checked during streaming. A malicious or
misbehaving server cannot fill the disk by sending an unbounded
response.

**Rootfs name validation.** The `-r`/`--fs` parameter (on `create` and
`new`) is validated with `validate_name()` (alphanumeric, hyphens, no
leading/trailing hyphens, no `..`) before being used to construct
filesystem paths.

**Opaque directory validation.** Paths must be absolute, contain no
`..` components, no empty strings, no duplicates. Normalised before
storage.

**Permission hardening.** Config files are written with mode `0o600`,
config directories with `0o700`. Overlayfs work directories get mode
`0o700`.

**Umask enforcement.** Container creation refuses to proceed if the
process umask strips read or execute from "other"
(`umask & 005 != 0`). A restrictive umask would make overlayfs
upper-layer files inaccessible to non-root services like dbus-daemon,
preventing container boot. This actually happened during development
when setting umask to 007 before the `sdme create` command, would
result in `sdme start` mysteriously misbehaving.

If you find a way to escape a container, traverse a path, or corrupt
the host filesystem through sdme, please open an issue.

## 15. Reliability

Multi-step operations in sdme are designed to fail cleanly rather than
leave broken state behind.

**Transactional imports** use a staging directory
(`.{name}.importing`) that is atomically renamed on success. Partial
imports are either cleaned up immediately or detected and reported on
the next run.

**Cooperative interrupt handling** uses a global `AtomicBool` flag set
by a POSIX `SIGINT` handler. The handler is installed without
`SA_RESTART`, so blocking system calls (file reads, network I/O) return
`EINTR` immediately. Import loops, boot-wait loops, and build
operations check the flag between steps, allowing Ctrl+C to cancel
cleanly at any point. The handler also restores the default `SIGINT`
disposition after the first press, so a second Ctrl+C force-kills the
process. This covers cases where Rust's stdlib retries
`poll()`/`connect()` on EINTR, preventing cooperative cancellation
during blocked DNS resolution or TCP connection attempts.

**Boot failure cleanup** differs by intent: `sdme new` removes the
container on boot or join failure (the user wanted a running container,
not a broken one), while `sdme start` (from previous `sdme create`)
preserves it for debugging.

**Health checks** in `sdme ps` detect containers with missing
directories or missing rootfs and report them as `broken` rather than
crashing or silently hiding them.

**Build failure cleanup** removes the staging container and any partial
rootfs on error, regardless of which build step failed.

If you find a way to leave sdme's state inconsistent (a container that
can't be listed, removed, or recovered), please open an issue.
